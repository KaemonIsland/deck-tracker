# deck-tracker

An application that tracks the state of your MTG deck so you never have to shuffle again!

# Idea

Basically this application would keep track of your library to make things like thorough shuffling no longer required.
The user would submit their deck on their own account while keeping their physical deck nicely in order. The app will
show the user what cards to draw and handle other things like scrying, searching, shuffling, etc.

Of course this app wouldn't be standard legal but I believe it would be a nice alternative to endlessly shuffling decks.
I'm especially thinking of Commander decks that are sleeved!
